CPS Font Viewer allows one to select a specified font for their designing or other task. This software displays the list of all fonts installed in the system along with a small preview window. Initially a sample text can be used to filter some desired fonts and later it can be further taken to the Filter window where the user can select a single font. The filter window allows to see the samples for the text that user actually needs to apply for that includes customization of background and text colour, Font sizes and Styles.
